# Mental_Health_In_Tech


This project explores mental health in the tech workplace using a 2014 survey of professionals from various countries. The goal is to understand attitudes toward mental health, treatment-seeking behavior, and how workplace factors like anonymity, benefits, and remote work affect mental wellness.

The dataset includes responses from employees about their age, gender, job type, mental health history, and workplace support systems. It provides a snapshot of how mental health is perceived and addressed in tech environments, helping inform HR policies and wellness programs.

We began by cleaning the data, correcting inconsistent entries in fields like gender, removing age outliers, and encoding categorical responses. This was crucial for ensuring meaningful and accurate visualizations and analysis.
### Main Takeaways:

- Mental health support is inconsistent across companies; access often depends on company size and culture.

- Stigma remains high, especially when disclosing issues to supervisors or during interviews.

- Remote work and awareness of resources play a role in treatment-seeking behavior.

- Data-backed insights can help companies create safer, more inclusive environments and build targeted mental health initiatives.
